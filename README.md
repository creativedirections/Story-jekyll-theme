# Story-jekyll-theme
Story theme from [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net) with jekyll blogging engine 

## Contributing
Fork this repo, make changes, submit a pull request and I'll review it. Just simple stuff!

## How to use this
Still a WIP, but very close to being useful. May be you can try to edit some variables in ```_data/``` files to see if it works right. Open an issue so that I keep up to it.

## Credits
This template is made using the design from [HTML UP](https://html5up.net) and ruby based [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) blogging engine.

Say hello to Story, a brand new responsive one-pager for HTML5 UP! Inspired by my work
on Carrd*, Story is built to be extremely modular and tweakable, and as such is entirely
built on reusable, insanely customizable elements (like "spotlight" and "gallery") that
can be endlessly duplicated and tweaked into whatever you need to tell your story --
without, in many cases, touching *any* CSS. Check out index-demo.html for an interactive
demo, and index.html for the actual template. Enjoy!

you can use for pretty much whatever.

PS: Delete index-demo.html and assets/js/demo.js when you're done messing with the demo
as neither are needed in production :)
